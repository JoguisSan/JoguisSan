# Hey there! 👋

I'm a developer who gets excited about building things that actually work. Been coding for a while now, and I still get that rush when everything clicks into place.

## What I work with

**Frontend stuff:**
- React is my go-to for anything interactive
- JavaScript/TypeScript - can't live without it
- HTML5 & CSS3 - the foundations never get old
- Building responsive UIs that don't break on mobile

**Backend:**
- Java when things need to be solid and scalable
- PHP for web projects (yes, modern PHP is actually good)
- REST APIs that make sense
- Database work - MySQL, PostgreSQL

**Tools I use daily:**
- Git (obviously)
- VS Code
- Docker when I need things containerized
- npm/yarn for package management

## Currently working on

Right now I'm diving deeper into:
- Performance optimization (making things fast is addictive)
- Modern React patterns - hooks, context, the whole deal
- Clean code principles (always room to improve)

## What gets me going

I love the moment when you finally figure out that bug that's been driving you crazy for hours. Or when you refactor something and it just *works better*. Those little wins keep me coding.

Also a big fan of:
- Open source projects
- Learning new frameworks (even if I don't always need them)
- Coffee. Lots of coffee.

## How I approach projects

I try to write code that other people (including future me) can actually understand. Comments when they matter, clean structure, and tests when it makes sense. Not everything needs to be perfect, but it should work and be maintainable.
