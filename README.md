# Welcome 👋

I build web applications. Some turn out great, some teach me what not to do next time. Either way, i'm always coding.

## Stacks

**Languages:** Java • JavaScript • TypeScript • PHP • SQL

**Frontend:** React • HTML5 • CSS3 • Responsive Design

**Backend:** Spring Boot • Express.js • REST APIs

**Databases:** MySQL • PostgreSQL • MongoDB

**Tools:** Git • Docker • VS Code • Postman

## What I'm focused on

Right now I'm working with React for frontend work and Java/Spring Boot on the backend. I like building things that solve real problems, not just tutorials that look good on paper.

Recently been learning:
- Advanced React patterns
- Spring Boot best practices
- Database optimization
- CI/CD pipelines

## The way I code

I write code thinking about the person who'll maintain it (usually future me at 2 AM). That means:
- Meaningful names, not `foo` and `bar`
- Comments when the "why" isn't obvious
- Breaking things into smaller functions
- Tests for the parts that matter

Not perfect, but getting better at it.

## My projects

Most of my repos are experiments, learning projects, or work in progress. The ones I'm actually proud of are pinned below. 

I'm particularly interested in:
- E-commerce platforms
- Dashboard applications
- RESTful API development
- Real-time web applications

## Philosophy

I believe good code is code that works and can be changed easily. Everything else is secondary.

Also believe in:
- Shipping features over bikeshedding syntax
- Learning by building, not just reading
- Open source when possible
- Taking breaks before debugging at 3 AM

## Let's connect

Working on something interesting? Have questions about my projects? Just want to talk shop?

I'm around. Drop a message or open an issue.

**Current status:** Probably refactoring something that already worked
